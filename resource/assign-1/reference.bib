abstract = {Underwater backscatter is a recent networking technology that enables net-zero-power communication and sensing in underwater environments. Existing research on underwater backscatter has focused on designing and demonstrating early systems with impressive capabilities; however, what remains critically missing is an end-to-end analysis of the underwater backscatter communication channel, which is necessary to understand the potential of this technology to scale to real-world applications and practical deployments.This paper presents the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis of the underwater backscatter channel, including the downlink and uplink of end-to-end backscatter. We introduce a closed-form analytical model that encompasses the physical properties of piezoelectric materials, electromechanical coupling, electrical impedance, and the underwater acoustic channel. We verify the correctness of this theoretical analysis through both finite-element-model physical simulations and real-world experimental validation in a river, demonstrating that the analytical model matches our real-world experiments with a median deviation of only 0.76 dB. Using this model, we then simulate the theoretical limits of underwater backscatter as a function of different design parameters and identify pathways for pushing underwater backscatter toward its theoretical limits.},

abstract = {We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of Van Atta Acoustic Backscatter (VAB), a technology that enables long-range, ultra-low-power networking in underwater environments. At the core of VAB is a novel, scalable underwater backscatter architecture that bridges recent advances in RF backscatter (Van Atta architectures) with ultra-low-power underwater acoustic networks. Our design introduces multiple innovations across the networking stack, which enable it to overcome unique challenges that arise from the electro-mechanical properties of underwater backscatter and the challenging nature of low-power underwater acoustic channels. We implemented our design in an end-to-end system, and evaluated it in over 1,500 real-world experimental trials in a river and the ocean. Our evaluation in stationary setups demonstrates that VAB achieves a communication range that exceeds 300m in round trip backscatter across orientations (at BER of 10−3). We compared our design head-to-head with past state-of-the-art systems, demonstrating a 15\texttimes{} improvement in communication range at the same throughput and power. By realizing hundreds of meters of range in underwater backscatter, this paper presents the first practical system capable of coastal monitoring applications. Finally, our evaluation represents the first experimental validation of underwater backscatter in the ocean.},

abstract = {Summary Underwater acoustic channel is a challenging medium for communication due to the presence of significant multipath, high noise, frequency-dependent propagation loss, and high and non-uniform Doppler spread. Doppler shift is non-negligible in underwater communication due to the low velocity of underwater signals. Synchronization and Doppler estimation are important requirements for achieving good performance in this channel. Synchronization algorithms that give good performance in radio communication do not work well in underwater communication. Hence, this area has received a lot of attention from researchers. This paper surveys important works in the area. The techniques proposed in the literature for frame synchronization, frequency and phase synchronization, and timing synchronization in single carrier communications are reviewed here. The synchronization techniques proposed for OFDM, MIMO OFDM, and spread spectrum communication are also surveyed. Doppler estimation methods proposed in the literature are also reviewed. It is found that most of the recent works in underwater acoustic communication focus on OFDM synchronization. Deep learning-based methods proposed in the literature are also reviewed. Key open problems and areas that require future research attention in the field of synchronization and Doppler estimation in underwater communications are highlighted in this paper. The area needing most attention of underwater communication researchers was found to be MIMO OFDM due to the difficulty in synchronization in such systems while used in underwater communication. Reducing the computational complexity of the algorithms used is also important for future work. Schemes that work with Doppler due to relative velocity over 10 m/s also need to be developed.},

abstract = {Path loss of an underwater acoustic communication channel depends not only on the transmission distance, but also on the signal frequency. As a result, the useful bandwidth depends on the transmission distance, a feature that distinguishes an underwater acoustic system from a terrestrial radio one. This fact influences the design of an acoustic network: a greater information throughput is available if messages are relayed over multiple short hops instead of being transmitted directly over one long hop. We asses the bandwidth dependency on the distance using an analytical method that takes into account physical models of acoustic propagation loss and ambient noise. A simple, single-path time-invariant model is considered as a first step. To assess the fundamental bandwidth limitation, we take an information-theoretic approach and define the bandwidth corresponding to optimal signal energy allocation -- one that maximizes the channel capacity subject to the constraint that the transmission power is finite. Numerical evaluation quantifies the bandwidth and the channel capacity, as well as the transmission power needed to achieve a pre-specified SNR threshold, as functions of distance. These results lead to closed-form approximations, which may become useful tools in the design and analysis of acoustic networks.},

abstract = {Acoustic modem is one of the key elements of an underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN). Compared to a terrestrial wireless sensor network (WSN), designing a UWSN is more time consuming and expensive due to harsh conditions of the aquatic environment. Commercial modems provide better characteristics, but they consume more energy and are more expensive, while research modems have exploited diverse alternatives with varying success. The main contribution of the article is a comparative analyses of commercial and research modems based on their characteristics and design constraints, in order to describe the current trends and more promising techniques. This paper is focused on the state-of-the-art underwater acoustic modems designed, developed and implemented in the last few years. Various parameters of the modems are considered and analyzed: operating range, data-rate, modulation schemes, center frequency, bandwidth, power consumption, bit error rates, etc. Finally, design challenges, which need to be addressed, are identified. This study is useful for the engineering community to comprehend the characteristics, trends and design challenges of state-of-the-art underwater acoustic communication modems.},
